**Today's Progress**: Fixing exercises on conditionals.

**Thoughts:** I'm still having problems to deal with the sintax, although my logic to solve the problems are having a good improvement.

### Day 2: January 15, 2022

**Today's Progress**: keep practicing conditional exercises.

**Thoughts:** Finally I'm understanding the sintax for conditionals using kotlin. The tips is to use simples questions and works on. The exercise about ordering a sequence of numbers was at first confuse, but I found a great material to understand how it works and I could applied in kotlin.
